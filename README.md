# Timesheet

Proof of concept timesheet webapp created for a University project in a few days

Built on a very minimalistic CMS system called mini3:

The calendar uses a trail version of day pilot pro:

Table formatting and export functionality is courtesy of data tables:

The following files were written by myself and need tidying up, but this was relegated due to time constraints and because programming wasnâ€™t marked as part of the assignment:

application/view/*   
application/Model/*  
application/Controller/*  
application/public/css/style.css  


## Installation

1. Run `composer install` from the root folder
2. Run database_create_insert.sql to create and populate the 'kits' database
3. Set your database IP, user and password in application/config/config.php
4. Point your httpd to the /public folder with re-writes enabled
